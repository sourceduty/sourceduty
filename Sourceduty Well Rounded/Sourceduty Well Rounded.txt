The "Sourceduty Knowledge‑Base Coverage" chart provides a visual assessment of the breadth and balance of Sourceduty’s digital competencies, as derived from its publicly available GitHub repositories and known project domains. By mapping key operational categories—such as mathematics and calculators, DevOps and programming, AI chat systems, command architecture, business logic, agriculture technology, and 3D modeling—onto a circular polar diagram, the chart reveals both areas of concentration and those with minimal representation. The sectors are weighted based on relative repository presence or domain-specific activity, giving a normalized view of how comprehensively each domain is represented within the knowledge infrastructure. For example, mathematics and programming, each with multiple repositories or tools, naturally show stronger representation, while emerging areas like agriculture tech and business strategy, though present, are proportionally smaller in scope.

This representation holds diagnostic value for internal audits and strategic planning. From an architectural perspective, the current coverage suggests a solid technical core centered around computational tooling and automation support. However, the uneven distribution implies that some fields—like food science integration and business workflows—may not yet be as developed or integrated into Sourceduty's active codebase. This may reflect either recent expansion efforts, under-documented projects, or the absence of formal tooling in those areas. As a result, the visual imbalance is not simply an indicator of oversight but an opportunity for targeted growth. In practice, this visualization can be paired with project planning sessions or quarterly reviews to ensure that underrepresented domains are supported with new tools, documentation, or community collaborations to even out the knowledge structure.

Furthermore, the chart can be used as a benchmarking tool to support Sourceduty’s goal of achieving “well-rounded” AI and digital infrastructure. A balanced polar coverage would signal a mature, interdisciplinary ecosystem capable of supporting a wide range of applications, from symbolic AI and robotic command systems to socially conscious modeling and agricultural sustainability. This aligns with Sourceduty’s ethos of ethically driven, adaptive innovation. As the organization expands into areas like quantum simulation or bias-aware design systems, future versions of this chart can serve to visually track development progress, spotlight domain saturation or neglect, and validate strategic diversification. By grounding technical breadth in measurable, interpretable metrics, this visualization becomes more than a snapshot—it becomes a navigational tool for guiding organizational evolution.
